# Development Guidelines

- This `GEMINI.md` file serves as my memory. I will add to it as we build new features.
- Most files I need are under the `lib` folder.
- I will refer to `lib/openapi-v4.yaml` for the API specification.
- I will use extensive `debugPrint` logging to help with debugging.
- I will run `flutter analyze` frequently to catch compile-time errors early.
- You can help with runtime testing and provide feedback from backend logs (Express.js/MongoDB) and Postman tests.
- We are developing for an emulator, so the base API URL is `http://10.0.2.2:3000/api`. My IDE is VS Code.
- If I have any questions, doubts, or confusion, I will let you know.
